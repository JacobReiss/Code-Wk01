Welcome to the Jumper game!

This game plays very similar to the classic game of "Hangman"

The player will guess a letter in the unknown word. If the guess is right, it will be added to the spot where the letter is. If the guess is wrong, the jumper will lose part of his parachute.

The player has 4 guesses to get the word right. Goodluck!
